A bank object encapsulates a block of memory you can use to store arbitrary data.

Banks are useful for storing data that is of no fixed type - for example, the contents
of a binary file.

To create a bank, use the #CreateBank command.

To write data to a bank, use one of 'Poke' style commands, such as #PokeByte.

To read data from a bank, use one of the 'Peek' style commands, such as #PeekByte.

In addition, banks can be loaded or saved using #LoadBank or #SaveBank.
