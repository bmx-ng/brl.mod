
This module provides a generic way to hook into various BlitzMax commands, and to add support for 
hooks into your own code.

The following hook ids are currently used by BlitzMax modules:

[ @{Hook id} | @Description | @Data
* FlipHook | A Max2D #Flip is about to occur | Null
* EmitEventHook | An event has been emitted by a call to #EmitEvent | A #TEvent object
]
To hook into any of these functions, use #AddHook with the specified hook id and your hook function.

To provide hook support for your own code, use #AllocHookId to generate a valid integer hook id 
somewhere in your program's startup code. Then, when the section of code you would like to be 
'hookable' is about to execute, simply call #RunHooks with the previously generated hook id and your
own custom 'data' object.
