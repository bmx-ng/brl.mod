
The event queue is a simple first-in, first-out queue that is used to collect 
#TEvent objects emitted by your application.

The #PollEvent and #WaitEvent commands can be used to receive the next event from the event
queue, while the #PeekEvent command can be used to check if the event queue is empty.

Events are added to the event queue using #PostEvent.
