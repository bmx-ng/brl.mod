
The BASIC compatibility module provides miscellaneous functions that emulate the behaviour
of 'classic' BASIC.

The functions in this module have largely been superceded by BlitzMax features such as 
'string slicing', and the Find, Replace, Trim, ToLower and ToUpper string methods.

However, for programmers from a classic BASIC background, these utility functions should make
the transition to BlitzMax a little easier.

NOTE: Strings in classic BASIC are '1 based'. This means that the first character within a 
string is at index 1, the second at index 2 and so on. However, BlitzMax strings are '0 based',
meaning the first character is at index 0, the second at index 1 and so on. The #instr and
#Mid functions in this module retain the '1 based' behaviour of classic BASIC.
