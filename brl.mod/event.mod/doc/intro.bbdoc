
Event objects are used to notify your application about external events such as user input, 
user interface activity and so on.

The are two main ways your program can receive events: either by adding a hook function to 
the #EmitEventHook hook, or by using using the global #{event queue}

The most important field in an event object is the @id field, which identifies the kind of 
event:
