A bank stream allows you to read data into or out of a bank. A bank stream can be used with
any of the stream commands, or anywhere a #TStream object is expected.

To create a bank stream, use the #CreateBankStream command.

As with all streams, you should use #CloseStream when you are finished with the bank stream.
