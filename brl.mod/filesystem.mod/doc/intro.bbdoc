
The BlitzMax filesystem module contains commands to perform operations on the computer's
files and directories.

#OpenFile, #ReadFile and #WriteFile return a stream object for reading and or writing data
to files.

Directories can be examined file by file using a combination of the
#ReadDir, #NextFile and #CloseDir commands, or #LoadDir can be used to read the file names
of a directory into a string array.

File properties can be examined with the #FileType, #FileTime, #FileSize and #FileMode commands.

Files and directories (folders) can be created and deleted with the #CreateFile, #CreateDir
#DeleteFile and #DeleteDir commands.

Finally, the FileSystem module contains various utility functions for handling file paths
in a system independent manner. These commands include #RealPath, #StripDir, #StripExt,
#StripAll, #ExtractDir and #ExtractExt.
