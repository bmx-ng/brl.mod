The Blitz runtime module provides low level functionality required by  BlitzMax applications when they are running. This includes things like memory management, exception handling and string and array operations.<br>

Much of the functionality provided by this module is hidden from application programmers, but is instead used 'behind the scenes' by the compiler. However, there are some very useful commands for debugging, memory management and simple standard IO.
