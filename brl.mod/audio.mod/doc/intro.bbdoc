
The BlitzMax audio module contains commands to load and play sounds.

A sound file can be played in BlitzMax with a combination of #LoadSound that loads a sound file
and #PlaySound which plays the sound through the systems audio system if available.

BlitzMax contains native support for sound files in both .wav (uncompressed)
and .ogg (compressed) file formats.

Playback of sounds can be controlled with various audio channel
operators including #SetChannelVolume, #SetChannelPan, #SetChannelDepth and #SetChannelRate.

A channel handle is obtained from either the return value of #PlaySound and #CueSound or from
reserving a channel with #AllocChannel.
