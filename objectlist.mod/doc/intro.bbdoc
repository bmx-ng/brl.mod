The #TObjectList is a #Type bringing together the memory efficient storage of arrays 
and the easy manageability of a #TMap or #TList. In most cases it is faster than the named 
alternatives but of course it depends on the way you are using it in your code. 

So make sure to benchmark according to your individual use case.
